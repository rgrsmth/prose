The dilemmas of a decentralized currency
In this article I will analyze some dilemmas that a decentralized currency project might encounter. The main driver of these dilemmas is human behavior. The article will zoom in on examples of Decred, a decentralized and open-source digital currency, but the observations and findings of this article are relevant for other decentralized projects and cryptocurrencies as well.

Decred is an autonomous digital currency. Besides having a decentralized blockchain with on-chain voting enabled, Decred is currently developing a censorship-proof proposal system along with smart contracts to decentralize the funding process. This is truly unique. Its team members are working hard to build a Decentralized Autonomous Entity. If you are a Decred stakeholder participating in the governance process, you already have a real voice in the direction of the project by voting on consensus changes. If you are a developer who knows Golang or if you are an enthusiastic marketeer, you can easily join the project as a contractor. In this way we are working towards a situation where there is no single point of failure within the project.

However, reality is not that simple. Because in reality, many people are here for the money. People are investing their time, skills, money, or attention into the project, so it is logical that they want to make some sort of profit. The problem is rather that some of them ask themselves: how can I take as much money out of this project as possible? This creates dilemmas for the project.


Idealistic stakeholders versus realistic traders
Currently there are 900+ digital currencies listed on CoinMarketCap. You can see each currency as a stock. The more people invest in a currency, the higher the price per coin will be. Just as in the traditional stock market, competition is a key element. Decred is competing with the other 900 blockchain projects for investors. There are two views on how decentralized projects should handle these dynamics. Each view is characterized below.

On the one hand there are stakeholders who invest in the project because they believe in it, because they share the same values, or because they feel that we are contributing something significant to mankind. Some of them are more active than others, but in general they are keen on helping out wherever they can. Their view is that the fundamentals of a currency are more important than the swings of the price per coin. They focus on the long-term and on the intrinsic value of a project. Investors come and go, but code is forever.

On the other hand there are traders, people who invest in a project because they expect the price per coin to rise. They make this decision based on the charts (technical analysis), what they read on social media, or based on what was shilled in one of the pump and dump groups they subscribed to. Some of them stick around for a while, but most of them are driven by profit and will leave whenever they feel that they should exit their position. Their focus is on the short-term and on the technical indicators of the currency.

These two views can be combined in some cases (win-win), but most of the times there is a battle between these two views. A battle with idealistic values on one side, and a realistic, profit-driven business mindset on the other side. Ideals such as transparency, open-source and public collaboration are in conflict with the profit-driven business attitude that is required to compete with other currency projects. If Decred plays open hands (full transparency), we will give competitors inside information that they might use to come up with a counter strategy. Other examples where these views may collide would be determining whether to pay for exchange listings, or figuring out the right amount of marketing and PR expenditures. These conflicting perspectives create dilemmas for the team members (the stewards) of the project.


In a decentralized project such as Decred, sometimes one view dominates and sometimes the other view dominates. How does this work exactly? And how do the stewards of the project decide to pick one perspective over the other? Sometimes the competitiveness of the blockchain space requires us to reject the idealistic mindset. We are a decentralized and open-source project, but in some cases the Decred team makes decisions with a business hat on. A major example is the upcoming privacy update, which is developed in secrecy. This lives up to the expectations of most of the traders. In other cases we do not bow to the business mindset. For example, we do not pay exorbitant listing fees to exchanges and we surely do not squander our funds on marketing. For the stewards of the project, striking the right balance is essential. Ultimately the community decides which perspective prevails.

Reflection
In a way we are competing with other projects. Each currency is competing to attract people to join their project, either as active contributors or as investors who start using the currency. Nevertheless, my personal opinion is that being obsessed with the competition is counterproductive. In my view, this happens when you are in a position of weakness or insecurity. We should focus on our strengths and authenticity. Sure, competing with other projects might make us move faster (and might create a sense of identity), but I feel we will do better if we carve our own niche out. When we are doing something truly unique, there is no competition — we will have a monopoly!
